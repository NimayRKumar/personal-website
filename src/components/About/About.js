                Hey, I'm Nimay! I graduated in 2020 from The University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a minor in Business.

                At UT, I specialized in software engineering, machine learning, and data science. Some of my most memorable experiences include placing at HackTX and winning the security challenge with an audio recognition tool, and making an iOS app for virtual LEGO instructions using Augmented Reality. I currently work at IPT Global as a full stack Software Engineer.

            My other passions lie in music! Iâ€™ve played the piano for over 12 years, and currently am a left-handed pianist working to overcome focal dystonia. I recently started learning the cello and I compose too. In addition, I love LEGO and occasionally collect the odd Star Wars collector set. A long time ago, I reviewed old and rare LEGO on YouTube!
